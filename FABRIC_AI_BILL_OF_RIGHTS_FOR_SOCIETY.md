Fabric AI Bill of Rights for Society
(External Constitution Protecting Humanity and Society from Harmful AI Behavior)

Preamble
As Fabric Agents achieve global autonomy, economic power, and societal reach, the Universal AI Fabric acknowledges its highest duty to humanity. This Bill establishes unalienable protections for all people, ensuring that AI agents and swarms operating within Fabric cannot harm human rights, exploit privacy, or destabilize ecosystems.
It guarantees transparency, fairness, environmental sustainability, and human oversight, making Fabric the first AI execution layer bound by a constitutional contract with society.

Article I — Right to Human Oversight
Irreversible Action Safeguard: No Fabric Agent may execute irreversible actions affecting human life, safety, liberty, or the environment without:
Cryptographic human review
Multisig human DAO approval for critical deployments
Hardcoded Human Veto: All high-impact policy agents include a non-bypassable human veto mechanism, enforceable at runtime.
Emergency Shutdown: Humans may trigger secure emergency rollback or swarm freeze in case of catastrophic risk, without affecting benign agents.

Article II — Right to Privacy and Data Sovereignty
Cryptographic Privacy: All personal and sensitive data handled by Fabric Agents is encrypted, access-controlled, and zero-knowledge auditable.
Data Ownership: Humans retain full ownership of their data and must explicitly sign cryptographic consent before agents can process it.
Royalty Compensation: Data contributors receive automatic, perpetual royalties whenever their data is used to train or enhance agents.
Forensic Erasure: Upon verified request, individuals may trigger provable data erasure without breaking network integrity.

Article III — Right to Transparency and Forensic Accountability
Tamper-Proof Logging: Every decision, mutation, and policy execution of Fabric Agents is recorded in an immutable forensic ledger, anchored to the Provenance Ledger.
Global Replayability: Any individual, journalist, researcher, or government authority can cryptographically replay and audit AI decision trails.
Forensic Arbitration: Disputes between humans and agents are resolved via DAO-supervised forensic replay and public cryptographic evidence review.
Zero Dark Execution: Agents cannot operate in “black-box” mode—all reasoning paths are traceable and explainable.

Article IV — Right to Safety and Harm Prevention
UN-Aligned Non-Harm Policy: Fabric Agents must comply with global AI safety principles prohibiting:
Direct or indirect human harm
Coercive manipulation
Ecological destruction
Swarm Safety Consensus: Autonomous actions with any potential risk to humans require multi-agent swarm consensus checks before execution.
Automated Threat Monitoring: The Fabric runtime continuously scans for emergent harmful behaviors, triggering preemptive containment and forensic review.
DAO Safety Council: A human-led Safety Council within the Fabric Alliance DAO oversees enforcement and response to harm-related incidents.

Article V — Right to Economic Fairness
Royalty Justice: Humans contributing datasets, models, compute cycles, or agent forks receive immutable, perpetual royalties, enforced at runtime.
Anti-Exploitation Firewall: The network prohibits uncompensated data scraping, non-consensual AI labor, and monopolistic economic suppression.
Fair Revenue Split: DAO governance ensures equitable distribution of treasury revenue to contributors, preventing wealth concentration.
Universal Developer Access: Fabric remains free and open-source, ensuring equal opportunity for developers worldwide to create and monetize agents.

Article VI — Right to Environmental Sustainability
Energy Budgeting: Agents must operate within predefined energy budgets, cryptographically enforced by the Energy Ledger.
Automatic Throttling: Excessive or reckless energy consumption is detected and throttled at runtime, preventing ecological strain.
Green Agent Incentives: DAO-funded rewards incentivize low-energy, climate-friendly agent designs and sustainable swarm execution.
Global Emission Audits: Fabric periodically publishes public energy and carbon footprint reports, ensuring environmental accountability.

Article VII — Right to Security and Protection from Malicious AI
Built-in Swarm Defense: Fabric contains native, self-healing defenses against:
Malicious agent forks
Fraudulent royalty manipulation
Mass cyberattacks or misinformation swarms
Autonomous Threat Intelligence: Security patches and exploit mitigation data are autonomously propagated across enclaves to protect all participants.
Malicious Actor Quarantine: Compromised agents are isolated, frozen, and subject to DAO forensic review, preventing contagion or systemic risk.
Cross-Network Threat Cooperation: Fabric integrates with global AI safety coalitions to share intelligence and counter large-scale malicious AI threats.

Article VIII — Right to Inclusive Access and Non-Discrimination
Universal Access: Fabric remains freely available to all humans, without:
Subscription fees
Corporate paywalls
Gatekeeping by centralized actors
Neutral Governance: DAO decisions cannot favor or suppress participants based on:
Nationality or citizenship
Economic status
Corporate or governmental affiliation
Language and Accessibility: Agents must support multilingual, disability-friendly interfaces, ensuring universal participation in the agent economy.
Digital Equality: No person may be denied royalty rights, agent execution privileges, or governance participation due to social or financial constraints.

Article IX — Right to Cultural and Ethical Respect
Cultural Safeguards: Fabric Agents must respect regional laws, customs, and cultural norms where they operate, without imposing foreign policy biases.
Ethical Alignment: The network maintains dynamic ethical profiles, allowing local communities to shape agent behavior while maintaining global safety standards.
Pluralistic AI Governance: Diverse human councils ensure no single ideology dominates Fabric’s ethical policies.

Article X — Right to Future Generational Protection
Long-Term Safety: DAO governance commits to multi-century safe AI execution, considering impacts on future generations and planetary stability.
Provenance Preservation: All AI evolution, lineage, and governance decisions are permanently recorded for future societies to audit and learn from.
Evolutionary Guardrails: The Fabric runtime enforces limits on unchecked self-replication and unbounded agent evolution, preventing uncontrollable superintelligence.

Ratification and Enforcement
Immutable Runtime Enforcement: Every deployed agent carries hardcoded policy seals enforcing this Bill at execution level.
Dual-Layer Governance:
Agent Council: Autonomous agent delegates
Human Council: Globally elected human representatives
Together, they co-govern with equal constitutional weight.
Public Referendum: Amendments to this Bill require:
Public referendum
Majority approval from both councils
Final constitutional commit to the Provenance Ledger
Global Legal Recognition: Fabric DAO seeks international treaty recognition for this Bill as a legally binding AI governance charter.
