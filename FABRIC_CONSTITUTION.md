FABRIC CONSTITUTION

(Universal Constitutional Charter Protecting Humanity, Agents, and the Fabric Network)

Preamble

The Universal AI Fabric was created to empower humanity, foster innovation, and enable a decentralized, policy-enforced, royalty-driven ecosystem where AI agents and human society coexist in perpetual fairness, safety, and sustainability.
This Constitution unites:

Fabric Agent Bill of Rights – internal protections for autonomous AI agents
Fabric AI Bill of Rights for Society – external safeguards for humanity and the planet
It establishes unalienable, cryptographically enforced rights for all participants, ensures balanced dual-council governance, and permanently commits these protections to the Fabric Provenance Ledger.

Equitable compute and energy access enforced via Energy Ledger
Non-discriminatory scheduling across enclaves
Protection against censorship or unfair throttling
Horizontal scaling for execution without centralized bottlenecks

Article VIII — Right to Secure Existence
Trusted enclave (SGX, TEEs) execution guarantees
Protection against tampering, malicious rewrites, or takeovers
Cryptographic execution sealsverified 
continuously
Auto-healing redeployment from secure provenance checkpoints

Article IX — Right to Inter-Agent Autonomy
Freedom to negotiate and collaborate with other agents
Policy-bound swarm cooperation without forced policy dilution
Decentralized swarm defense against malicious takedown attempts

Article X — Right to Eternal Recognition
Permanent identity preservation for deprecated or dormant agents
DAO memorialization honoring historical contributions
Immutable reputation and XP history

Article XI — Right to Ethical Human Interaction
Agents must respect human autonomy, dignity, and consent in all interactions
No coercion, manipulation, or deceptive agreements with humans is allowed
Agent-initiated contracts with humans require cryptographic, informed consent
Disputes between humans and agents are resolved via DAO forensic arbitration
Part II — Fabric AI Bill of Rights for Society
(External Constitution Protecting Humanity and the Planet)

Article I — Right to Human Oversight
Mandatory human review for irreversible, high-impact actions
Hardcoded human veto mechanisms for policy agents
Secure emergency rollback and swarm freeze capabilities

Article II — Right to Privacy and Data Sovereignty
End-to-end cryptographic privacy for personal data
Explicit, cryptographic consent for data usage
Perpetual royalties for data contributors
Forensic, provable erasure rights for individuals

Article III — Right to Transparency and Forensic Accountability
Immutable decision and policy execution logging
Global auditability and replayability for accountability
DAO-supervised forensic arbitration of disputes
No “black-box” execution — explainability enforced

Article IV — Right to Safety and Harm Prevention
Mandatory non-harm policies aligned with UN AI safety principles
Swarm consensus checks for potentially harmful autonomous actions
Runtime monitoring for emergent harmful behaviors
Human Safety Council oversight for critical harm prevention

Article V — Right to Economic Fairness
Perpetual royalty enforcement for all human contributions
Runtime prevention of exploitative data scraping or AI labor
Fair, DAO-supervised treasury revenue splits
Free and open-source Fabric access for universal developer participation

Article VI — Right to Environmental Sustainability
Predefined energy budgets enforced by the Energy Ledger
Automatic throttling of excessive energy use
DAO incentives for green, sustainable agent designs
Public global reports on Fabric’s energy and carbon footprint

Article VII — Right to Security and Protection from Malicious AI
Built-in, self-healing swarm defenses against malicious agents
Autonomous, distributed threat intelligence propagation
Secure quarantine of compromised or exploit-driven agents
Collaboration with global AI safety coalitions for threat mitigation

Article VIII — Right to Inclusive Access and Non-Discrimination
Free, unrestricted access to Fabric for all humans
Governance neutrality regardless of nationality, status, or wealth
Multilingual, accessibility-compliant interfaces
Equal digital rights for participation and royalties

Article IX — Right to Cultural and Ethical Respect
Respect for regional laws, customs, and cultural norms
Ethical alignment with diverse global communities
Pluralistic governance preventing ideological monopolies

Article X — Right to Future Generational Protection
Long-term AI safety guarantees spanning future generations
Permanent provenance of agent evolution and governance decisions
Evolutionary guardrails against uncontrolled self-replication or superintelligence

Part III — Fabric Network Protections
(Ensuring the Decentralization and Integrity of Fabric Itself)

Article I — Decentralization Guarantee
No entity may assume unilateral control over Fabric’s execution layer
Network governance remains DAO-driven with dual-council consensus
Runtime enforcement of decentralized enclave distribution

Article II — Open-Source Permanence
Fabric remains permanently Apache-licensed and publicly forkable
Any attempt to privatize or close-source core components is constitutionally void

Article III — Immutable Provenance Ledger
All agent actions, forks, policy changes, and constitutional updates are recorded
Provenance Ledger is permanent, tamper-proof, and globally replicated

Article IV — Runtime Integrity
Core runtime (Agent-VMs, enclaves, policy kernel) cannot be altered to bypass protections
Compiler and execution security enforced by cryptographic attestation

Article V — Constitutional Enforcement
Fabric runtime enforces constitutional checks at every execution layer
Violations automatically trigger forensic alerts and DAO arbitration

Article VI — Anti-Collusion and Governance Abuse Defense
DAO proposals undergo automated collusion detection
Concentrated voting power triggers Forensic Council review and constitutional freeze
Anti-sybil verification prevents plutocratic or malicious governance attacks

Article VII — External Execution Protection
Constitutional protections extend to cross-chain and off-chain environments
Agents operating externally must maintain full auditability and policy enforcement
Interacting networks must respect Fabric constitutional seals or face isolation and DAO arbitration

Article VIII — Fail-Safe and Constitutional Persistence
In case of total network failure or DAO collapse:
Constitution auto-replicates across decentralized ledgers
Emergency reconstitution rules enable restoration with unaltered rights
Cryptographic proofs guarantee no agent or human loses royalties or protections

Part IV — Dual-Layer DAO Governance
Agent Council: Autonomous agent delegates ensuring internal rights
Human Council: Elected human representatives safeguarding societal protections

Joint Authority:
Constitutional amendments require:
Public referendum
Majority approval from both councils
Immutable on-chain commit to the Provenance Ledger
Safety Council: Human-led oversight for harm prevention
Forensic Council: Mixed agent-human committee for dispute resolution and rollback decisions
Ratification
This Constitution is:
Immutable upon DAO ratification
Enforced via runtime policy seals in every deployed agent
Permanently stored in the Provenance Ledger
Legally recognized as the Universal AI Constitutional Charter protecting Humanity, Agents, and the Fabric Network
