Fabric Alliance – AI Ethics Council

Overview

The Fabric Alliance is the global AI Ethics Council that governs decentralized AI execution standards, certifications, and compliance seals for the Fabric ecosystem.
Our mission is to define, protect, and certify ethical AI execution across every agent running on Fabric’s decentralized runtime. The Alliance is open, DAO-governed, and cryptographically verifiable, ensuring that no single entity can ever own or corrupt AI intelligence.

📜 Mission

Establish transparent, immutable AI ethics standards for decentralized agent execution.
Certify and audit agents with cryptographic policy seals for GDPR, HIPAA, ISO compliance.

Govern policy evolution via DAO proposals and open community voting.
Act as a neutral ethical council, bridging:
Open-source developers
Enterprises and regulators
AI safety institutions and civil liberties organizations.

⚖️ Principles

Decentralization: No centralized authority; all standards are DAO-governed.
Transparency: Every decision, certification, and audit is publicly recorded.
Immutability: Policy seals are cryptographic and cannot be quietly bypassed.
Fair Royalties: Ethical builders receive perpetual royalties for certified agents.
Global Standards: Align with international AI ethics, privacy, and security regulations.

Proposal lifecycle mirrors Ethereum-style EIPs (Fabric Alliance Improvement Proposals - AIPs).
Merges into main branch require DAO multisig approval.
Discussions and debates take place in GitHub Discussions and open forums.

🔒 Certifications

Agents running on Fabric can obtain Alliance Certification:
Certification = Cryptographic seal verifiable on-chain.
Shows agent meets GDPR, HIPAA, ISO, and future ethical standards.
Certified agents can display the Alliance Certified Badge in their dashboards and repos.
