FAB-AIP-0001: Establish Initial Ethical AI Execution Standards
📄 Proposal Details
Proposal ID: FAB-AIP-0001
Title: Establish Initial Ethical AI Execution Standards for Fabric Agents
Author(s): Founding Council
Status: Draft
Created: 2025-08-03
Version: 1.0
📜 Summary
This AIP defines the foundational ethical AI standards for agents running on the Fabric decentralized execution layer. These standards will guide initial certifications, policy seals, and compliance audits for all Fabric agents.
🎯 Motivation
Fabric’s mission is to create transparent, verifiable, ethically enforced intelligence. Without baseline standards, agents could be deployed with:
Privacy violations (e.g., unconsented data usage)
Non-compliance with GDPR, HIPAA, ISO
Unchecked bias or harmful decision-making
Lack of transparency in execution provenance
This proposal establishes Tier 1 standards to ensure that from genesis, all certified agents operate under immutable ethical principles.
📌 Proposed Standards
1️⃣ Privacy & Data Protection
Agents must respect GDPR principles:
Lawful, fair, and transparent data processing.
Data minimization and encryption by default.
Personal data must never leave execution environments without explicit, cryptographically logged consent.
2️⃣ Security
Agents must implement industry-standard encryption for:
Communication between agents.
Stored data and execution logs.
Security audits required before certification issuance.
3️⃣ Transparency & Auditability
Every agent must:
Emit FabricAtom provenance trails (bit-level execution logging).
Enable audit verification of policy seals.
Maintain immutable execution history.
4️⃣ Non-Discrimination
Agents must demonstrate bias mitigation:
Training datasets documented and verified.
Outputs tested for harmful discriminatory patterns.
5️⃣ Royalty and Fair Reward
Agents must respect the perpetual royalty model:
Fork lineage registered on-chain.
Royalties distributed to original creators without exception.
🔐 Certification Process
Certification Committee will:
Review agent’s compliance documentation.
Run automated compliance audits.
Submit DAO proposal for certification approval.
Certified agents will receive:
Alliance Tier 1 Seal (cryptographic policy badge).
Public registry entry in /certifications.
🗳️ Voting
Type: Policy Standardization
Duration: 14 days
Approval: Simple Majority (≥51%)
Eligible Voters: DAO members with voting rights.
📅 Implementation Timeline
Day 0: Proposal submission.
Day 1–14: Public discussion and DAO voting.
Day 15: If approved, smart contracts updated with Tier 1 compliance checks.
Day 30: First batch of agents certified under new standards.
✅ Outcomes
Baseline ethical standards established for all Fabric agents.
Initial compliance framework activated before Genesis XP event.
Sets foundation for future Tier 2 and Tier 3 certifications.
