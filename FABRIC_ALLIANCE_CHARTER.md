Fabric Alliance Charter

Global AI Ethics Council for Decentralized Intelligence Execution

Preamble

Artificial Intelligence has become a core pillar of civilization. As its execution moves from centralized silos to decentralized fabrics of intelligence, humanity faces a historic choice:
Allow ungoverned, opaque AI to shape the future,
Or build transparent, verifiable, ethically enforced intelligence for all.
The Fabric Alliance is established as a neutral, decentralized governance body to ensure that every AI agent operating on the Fabric execution layer adheres to immutable ethical standards, protects human rights, and rewards innovation fairly and perpetually.

Article I – Mission and Purpose

The mission of the Fabric Alliance is to:
Define and enforce global AI ethics standards within decentralized execution environments.
Certify agents and networks that comply with privacy, fairness, and safety regulations.
Establish DAO-driven governance, ensuring no central authority can override ethical policy.
Provide cryptographic transparency for audits, certifications, and governance decisions.
Unify international AI safety institutions, regulators, and developers under a shared ethical framework.

Article II – Core Principles
Decentralization: Power is distributed through DAO governance and immutable smart contracts.
Transparency: Every policy, certification, and governance vote is recorded and verifiable on-chain.
Fairness: Perpetual royalties reward ethical builders of AI agents.
Compliance: Certification ensures alignment with GDPR, HIPAA, ISO, and evolving international standards.
Security: Certified agents must meet strict security and data protection criteria.
Human Rights Protection: AI must operate without bias, discrimination, or human rights violations.

Article III – Governance Structure

1. DAO Governance
All decisions, amendments, and certifications are controlled by the Fabric Alliance DAO.
Each DAO member has voting rights based on Royalty Bonds and XP-based credentials.
Voting results are publicly auditable and on-chain.

2. Council Seats
Founding members hold initial council seats.
Seats rotate annually via DAO elections.
Council may introduce policy proposals but cannot bypass DAO approval.

3. Improvement Proposals (AIPs)
Changes to the Charter, ethical policies, or certifications must follow the Alliance Improvement Proposal (AIP) process:
Draft AIP → Community discussion → DAO vote → On-chain approval → Merge into Charter.
