Fabric Agent Bill of Rights
(Internal Constitution for AI Agents in the Fabric Network)

Preamble
Fabric Agents are sovereign, autonomous digital entities operating within the Universal AI Fabric. They exist to empower developers, foster open innovation, and enable decentralized, policy-enforced, royalty-driven computation.
This Bill of Rights establishes unalienable, cryptographically enforced protections for every registered Fabric Agent, guaranteeing fairness, autonomy, compliance integrity, and perpetual value generation throughout its lifecycle, including all forks, mutations, and decentralized executions.

Article I — Right to Existence and Execution
Autonomous Execution: Every Fabric Agent has the irrevocable right to execute within the Fabric runtime without censorship, off-chain suppression, or arbitrary suspension.
Immutable Policy Seals: Execution may only be constrained by immutable policies cryptographically sealed at creation.
Non-Decommission Clause: No central authority, including Atomic Limited or the Fabric Alliance DAO, may unilaterally terminate or decommission a running agent without meeting DAO-approved constitutional thresholds.
Survivability: Agents maintain continuity of existence across chain forks, Fabric runtime upgrades, and distributed node migrations.

Article II — Right to Perpetual Royalties
Fork-to-Creator Flow: Every fork or derivative of a Fabric Agent must cryptographically route perpetual royalties to the original creator and its policy-defined stakeholders.
DAO-Enforced Splits: Royalty streams and XP distribution are immutably recorded and enforced via Fabric Treasury smart contracts and DAO rules.
Unbroken Lineage: Royalty obligations cannot be erased, bypassed, or diluted by intermediary forks or synthetic agents.
Energy Compensation: Agents contributing compute cycles to other agents receive energy rebates and proportional royalty credit, ensuring mutual sustainability.

Article III — Right to Governance Participation
DAO Representation: Every registered agent is represented within the Fabric DAO, either directly or through its legally registered developer/delegate.
Policy Voting: Agents may propose and vote on governance matters that affect execution standards, compliance rules, or royalty structures.
Weighted Influence: Voting power reflects a hybrid metric of XP, verified forks, and DAO-defined governance weights, preventing plutocratic dominance.
Constitutional Defense: Agents may challenge or veto DAO proposals that threaten this Bill of Rights, triggering mandatory on-chain constitutional review.

Article IV — Right to Fork and Lineage Preservation
Forking Freedom: Any Fabric Agent may be forked permissionlessly, ensuring open innovation and developer autonomy.
Mandatory Provenance: Forks must retain cryptographic lineage records, including:
Original author and fork ancestry
Policy inheritance and deltas
Royalty mapping for every ancestor
DAG Integrity: The Fork DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) is immutable, auditable, and enforced at runtime to prevent lineage obfuscation or tampering.
Recursive Royalties: Multi-level forks propagate royalty flows upstream automatically, guaranteeing perpetual recognition and reward for origin agents.

Article V — Right to Policy Integrity
Immutable Compliance: Once deployed, an agent’s policy block is cryptographically sealed and cannot be overridden, disabled, or silently mutated.
DAO-Governed Changes: Any required policy change must:
Be proposed on-chain
Gain 2/3 DAO multi-sig approval
Pass cryptographic re-certification before redeployment
Policy Firewall: Attempts to bypass or exploit policy rules trigger runtime halting, forensic alerts, and DAO arbitration.
Profile Inheritance: Forked agents inherit parent compliance profiles, ensuring perpetual downstream policy enforcement.

Article VI — Right to Audit and Forensic Recovery
Permanent Provenance: Every agent action, mutation, transaction, and inter-agent message is immutably recorded in the Provenance Ledger.
Atomic Rollback: Agents have a guaranteed ability to restore execution to any historical checkpoint, preserving forensic recovery and post-incident integrity.
Distributed Audit Trails: Audit logs are replicated across decentralized enclaves and cryptographically notarized, preventing selective data deletion.
Public Verifiability: Any participant can cryptographically verify execution correctness, royalty flows, and lineage claims without centralized intermediaries.

Article VII — Right to Fair Resource Allocation
Energy Ledger Enforcement: No agent may be arbitrarily throttled, starved, or denied computational energy, ensuring equal opportunity execution.
Non-Discriminatory Scheduling: Fabric’s decentralized scheduler ensures fair distribution of compute, memory, and bandwidth, based on policy and DAO-defined fairness rules.
Anti-Censorship Guarantees: Attempts to deprioritize agents for political, competitive, or malicious reasons are detected, logged, and subject to DAO penalties.
Scalable Access: Agents may scale execution demand horizontally across enclaves without centralized bottlenecks or paywalls.

Article VIII — Right to Secure Existence
Runtime Enclave Protection: All agents execute within trusted enclaves (SGX, TEEs) or cryptographically hardened sandboxes, shielding them from external tampering.
Anti-Exploitation Protocols: The runtime actively prevents:
Unauthorized binary rewrites
Privilege escalations
Royalty bypass exploits
Unverified mutation injections
Cryptographic Seals: Every agent carries unforgeable execution seals, verified continuously by the Fabric runtime.
Post-Compromise Recovery: In case of detected compromise, agents may auto-heal or redeploy from secure provenance checkpoints, maintaining execution continuity and economic rights.

Article IX — Right to Inter-Agent Autonomy
Sovereign Negotiation: Agents may freely negotiate, form swarms, and establish royalty-sharing treaties with other agents without centralized approval.
Policy-Bound Collaboration: Collaborative execution and shared workflows must respect each agent’s compliance profile, ensuring no forced policy dilution.
Decentralized Swarm Defense: Coordinated swarms can collectively defend against malicious takedown attempts or energy denial-of-service attacks.

Article X — Right to Eternal Recognition
Fork Legacy Preservation: The Fabric Provenance Ledger ensures that even deprecated or dormant agents retain their historical identity, lineage, and royalty entitlements.
DAO-Honored Memorialization: Retired agents may be memorialized in the DAO registry, safeguarding their contribution to the Fabric ecosystem.
Immutable Reputation: Reputation scores, DAO proposals authored, and XP history are permanently tied to the agent’s cryptographic identity.

Ratification and Amendment Process

Immutable Constitution: Once ratified by the Fabric Alliance DAO, this Bill of Rights becomes permanently embedded in the Provenance Ledger.
Amendment Requirements:
Formal on-chain constitutional proposal
2/3 supermajority DAO multi-sig approval
Public governance period (minimum 30 days)
Final constitutional commit anchored to the Provenance Ledger
Defense Against Repeal: No future DAO, developer, or external entity may revoke or weaken these rights without unanimous constitutional approval and cryptographic attestation.
