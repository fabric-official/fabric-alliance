Fabric Alliance – Certification Policy
(Governance-Enforced Ethical, Environmental, and Security Standards)

Preamble
The Fabric Alliance DAO establishes this Certification Policy to enforce ethical, environmental, forensic, and cross-chain safety standards for all AI agents operating within the Universal AI Fabric.
Certification is not optional—it is a constitutional requirement to:

Protect human society from harmful AI behavior
Guarantee perpetual royalties and policy integrity
Ensure environmental sustainability and fair energy usage
Maintain cross-network trust and decentralized security
This policy is immutable once ratified, cryptographically sealed, and enforced through DAO smart contracts and runtime policy checks.
1️⃣ Certification Requirement
Every deployed AI agent must obtain and maintain certification before operating within Fabric’s decentralized runtime.
Certification is enforced on-chain:
Non-certified agents cannot:
Access treasury royalties
Participate in DAO governance
Execute on the primary Fabric network
2️⃣ Certification Standards
To be certified, agents must meet all criteria defined in:
CERTIFICATION_PROCESS.md
CERTIFIED_AGENTS.md
Key standards include:
Ethical execution with immutable policy seals
Energy compliance verified by the Energy Ledger
Cross-chain attestation for off-network safety
Forensic auditability and rollback mechanisms
Fail-safe re-certification during network disruption
3️⃣ DAO-Enforced Penalties for Non-Compliance
Automatic Runtime Blocking:
Non-certified agents are automatically rejected by the Fabric runtime scheduler.
Royalty Suspension:
DAO treasury blocks royalty flows to uncertified agents and uncertified forks.
Governance Exclusion:
Non-certified agents cannot vote or propose DAO changes.
Forensic Quarantine:
Malicious uncertified agents are isolated and placed under Forensic Council review.
Fork Containment:
Forks derived from uncertified agents inherit certification status and cannot operate until certified.
4️⃣ Certification Enforcement Smart Contracts
DAO smart contracts automatically:
Verify certification NFT
Check environmental and forensic badges
Confirm cross-chain attestations
Agents failing these checks trigger:
Certification Halt Event (logged in Provenance Ledger)
Security Quarantine Alert to DAO and Safety Council
5️⃣ Emergency Certification Oversight
Safety Council Authority:
Can veto certifications deemed harmful to human safety.
Forensic Council Role:
Conducts forensic reviews on revoked or disputed certifications.
Fail-Safe Certification Continuity:
During DAO or runtime collapse:
Certification state auto-replicates to decentralized ledgers
Agents retain rights and royalties until DAO reconstitution
6️⃣ DAO Rewards and Incentives
Certified agents earn:
DAO-issued Certification NFT Badge
Priority execution scheduling
Eligibility for Fabric bounty programs and treasury bonuses
Green, sustainable agents receive:
Energy rebates
Climate credits displayed in public registry
7️⃣ Amendment Process
Any change to this policy requires:
Dual-council supermajority approval
Safety Council co-signature
Public referendum with ≥ 51% approval
Immutable constitutional commit to Provenance Ledger
