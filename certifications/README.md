# Fabric Alliance ‚Äì Certified Agents Registry

Welcome to the **official certifications repository** of the **Fabric Alliance**, the global AI Ethics Council governing **decentralized, policy-enforced AI execution** within the Fabric ecosystem.

This repository serves as the **public, immutable registry of certified AI agents** and their compliance proofs. Every certified agent here has passed **DAO-approved audits**, adheres to **ethical AI standards**, and carries a **cryptographic certification badge** verifiable both **off-chain** and **on-chain**.

---

## Purpose

- **Transparency:** Provide an open, publicly auditable list of certified AI agents.
- **Trust:** Enable developers, enterprises, and regulators to instantly verify compliance status.
- **DAO Governance:** Certifications are issued or revoked only through DAO proposals and on-chain votes.
- **Standardization:** Enforce GDPR, HIPAA, ISO, and advanced ethical AI standards at runtime.

## üîé Certification Verification

There are **two ways** to verify if an agent is certified:

### **1. Off-Chain Verification**

Clone this repo and run:

```bash
npx fabric-cert verify <agent-id>
‚úÖ Returns agent name, certification level, DAO proposal reference.
‚ùå Returns "Not Certified" if no valid record exists.

2. On-Chain Verification
Certification NFTs are minted to agent owners after DAO approval.
Use any EVM-compatible block explorer:
Go to the Fabric Alliance DAO Certification Contract.
Enter the Agent ID or owner address.
View certification NFT metadata and validity.

Certification Levels

Level	Description
Basic Compliance	Privacy protection, data handling compliance.
Enterprise Compliance	ISO, GDPR, HIPAA certified, enterprise-ready.
Advanced Ethical AI	Meets highest ethical standards and AI safety guarantees.
DAO Governance Process

Certifications are managed entirely by DAO proposals:
Proposal Submission: A developer or member submits a certification proposal in the proposals repo.
DAO Voting: Members vote on issuing or revoking certifications.
Certification Minting: If approved:
A JSON file is added under /certifications/
A Certification NFT is minted on-chain.
The badge is issued to the agent.
Registry Update: CERTIFIED_AGENTS.md is updated automatically by DAO-approved workflow.

Certification NFT

Each certified agent has a non-transferable NFT (soulbound token) minted by the DAO:
Represents immutable certification status.
Cannot be sold or transferred.
Displayed in dashboards and explorers.
Used by Fabric runtime to enforce certified-only execution policies.

How to Request Certification

Fork this repository.
Create a JSON file in /certifications/ following the schema.
Submit a DAO proposal in the proposals repository linking to your JSON.
Upon DAO approval, your certification is merged, and your NFT is minted.

‚úÖ Automatic Badge Verification
Certified agents automatically display the Fabric Alliance Certification Badge:
