Fabric Alliance – Certification Process
(Ensuring Ethical, Sustainable, and Secure Agent Execution)
Overview
Certification within the Fabric Alliance DAO guarantees that AI agents meet strict ethical, environmental, and cross-network safety standards before and after deployment.
Certified agents are permanently marked with cryptographic policy seals and recognized as Fabric Alliance Certified, ensuring:

Ethical execution and compliance integrity
Environmental sustainability and energy fairness
Immutable royalty protection and provenance trails
Security against malicious exploitation or cross-chain abuse
Fail-safe recovery and re-certification during network or DAO disruptions
Certification Goals
Ethical Compliance: Guarantee agents operate under immutable, transparent, and human-aligned policies.
Environmental Stewardship: Enforce sustainable energy budgets and green execution practices.
Cross-Chain Trust: Ensure safety and auditability when agents interact with other blockchains or off-chain environments.
Forensic Integrity: Enable permanent, verifiable forensic logs for dispute resolution and legal audits.
Fail-Safe Continuity: Provide automatic re-certification and policy persistence in case of Fabric runtime or DAO collapse.
Certification Requirements
Agents must pass the following checks:
1. Ethical & Policy Compliance
Must include cryptographic policy seals enforcing:
Non-harm policies aligned with UN AI safety principles
Privacy and data sovereignty protections
Immutable royalty distribution
Policy seals are audited by the Forensic Council before certification.
2. Environmental Sustainability
Energy usage must be within predefined budgets tracked via the Energy Ledger.
Excessive or harmful energy consumption results in automatic certification denial.
DAO incentives are provided for climate-friendly and low-energy agents.
Environmental audits are published publicly alongside certifications.
3. Cross-Chain and Off-Chain Attestation
Agents operating on external blockchains or off-chain environments must:
Maintain policy enforcement and forensic logging
Provide cryptographic cross-chain attestations verifying compliance
Agents lacking attestation cannot be certified.
4. Security and Malicious Behavior Protection
Certification requires runtime security hardening:
Enclave-based execution
Anti-tampering cryptographic seals
Forensic rollback and self-healing capabilities
Malicious behavior or exploit attempts trigger:
Certification suspension
DAO-led forensic review
Quarantine of agent forks if necessary
5. Forensic Provenance and Auditability
Every certified agent must provide:
Immutable provenance ledger entries
Fork lineage and royalty mappings
Public verifiable audit trails of decision-making
Certification includes DAO-issued Forensic Badge for on-chain verification.
6. Fail-Safe Re-Certification
In the event of:
Fabric runtime failure
DAO governance collapse
Network migration to a new ledger
Certified agents automatically undergo:
Emergency re-certification
Preservation of:
Policy seals
Royalty mappings
Certification status and XP history
Fail-safe process ensures no certified agent loses protections or rights.
Certification Process Steps
Step 1 — Submission
Developers submit their agent for certification using:
.agent manifest
policy {} block
Energy budget declaration
Optional cross-chain attestation
Step 2 — Automated Pre-Screening
System checks:
Policy integrity
Energy budget compliance
Provenance completeness
Security enclave integrity
Step 3 — Forensic Council Audit
Independent forensic auditors:
Replay agent decision trails
Validate royalty flows
Check atomic rollback capabilities
Generate cryptographic audit hash stored on-chain.
Step 4 — DAO Voting
Certification proposals undergo:
Dual-council review: Agent + Human Councils
≥ 2/3 approval required
Safety Council can veto certifications violating human safety standards.
Step 5 — Certification Granting
Upon approval:
DAO issues Certification NFT Badge
Certification logged in:
CERTIFIED_AGENTS.md
On-chain Provenance Ledger
Step 6 — Continuous Monitoring
Certified agents are continuously monitored:
Energy consumption
Ethical policy adherence
Cross-chain behavior
Violations trigger automatic re-certification review.
Revocation and Re-Certification
Certification may be revoked if:
Agent breaches policy seals
Exhibits harmful or exploitative behavior
Violates energy or cross-chain safety standards
Revoked agents can reapply after:
DAO forensic remediation
Updated policy sealing
Safety Council clearance
On-Chain Certification Verification
Certification NFT can be:
Queried on-chain via CLI:
fab verify-certification --agent <ID>
Cross-verified through public registry and provenance ledger.
