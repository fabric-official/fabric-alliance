Fabric Alliance ‚Äì Agent Certification Process
This document defines the official process for certifying AI agents under the Fabric Alliance ethical and compliance standards. Certification ensures agents deployed on the Fabric decentralized execution layer are safe, auditable, and policy-enforced.

Purpose

Guarantee ethical behavior and privacy protection in all certified agents.
Enforce perpetual royalty fairness and policy compliance.
Provide a trust framework for enterprises, developers, and regulators.
Establish transparent auditability and provenance logging.

Certification Levels

Tier 1 ‚Äì Privacy & Security
Baseline certification required for all agents.
Ensures GDPR/HIPAA data protection and encrypted communications.

Tier 2 ‚Äì Enterprise-Grade
Includes Tier 1 standards.
Adds ISO 27001/9001 alignment and advanced resilience testing.
Required for agents used in production-scale environments.

Tier 3 ‚Äì Advanced Ethical AI
Includes Tier 2 standards.
Adds bias mitigation, fairness testing, and human rights compliance.
Mandatory for agents deployed in healthcare, governance, and critical infrastructure.

üìù Transparency

All certification requests, audit reports, proposals, and voting results:
Stored publicly in this repository.
