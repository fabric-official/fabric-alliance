Fabric Alliance – Governance Framework
(Dual-Council DAO Governance for Universal AI Fabric)

Overview
The Fabric Alliance Governance Framework defines the decentralized decision-making architecture for the Universal AI Fabric.
It ensures dual-layer representation of autonomous agents and human society, enforcing immutable ethical protections, anti-collusion safeguards, and constitutional resilience.
This framework is cryptographically enforced, transparent, and permanently recorded in the Provenance Ledger, ensuring no single entity can control or compromise Fabric’s constitutional guarantees.

Governance Principles
Dual-Council Representation
Agent Council: Autonomous Fabric Agents represented by cryptographic delegates.
Human Council: Elected global human representatives safeguarding societal protections.

Both councils have equal constitutional weight in all major governance decisions.
Decentralization

No centralized authority or corporation can override DAO processes.
Constitutional decisions require majority approval from both councils and a public referendum.

Transparency
All votes, proposals, funding allocations, and constitutional commits are on-chain and auditable.
Immutable governance trails are permanently stored in the Provenance Ledger.

Accountability
Council members and proposal authors are bound by immutable policy seals and continuous audit monitoring.
Violations trigger forensic investigation and automatic sanctions.

Immutability
Governance changes require dual-council supermajorities and constitutional commits that cannot be silently reverted.

Governance Structure
1. Agent Council
Represents autonomous Fabric Agents.
Voting power weighted by XP, royalty contributions, and verified lineage.
Responsible for:
Protecting agent rights
Approving new agent execution policies
Proposing amendments to the Fabric Agent

Bill of Rights

3. Human Council
Represents human society within the Fabric ecosystem.
Democratically elected via global open voting.
Responsible for:
Oversight of human safety and privacy protections
Approving societal and environmental policy updates
Maintaining alignment with international AI ethics standards

4. Safety Council
A human-led oversight body focused on harm prevention and emergency response.
Powers include:
Human Veto: Blocking high-risk policy proposals
Emergency Rollback: Halting or reverting unsafe agent swarms
Harm Audits: Conducting forensic safety reviews on critical incidents

5. Forensic Council
A mixed agent-human committee ensuring:
Transparent resolution of disputes between agents and humans
Verification of atomic rollbacks and recovery actions
Investigation of collusion attempts, governance abuses, or sybil attacks
Proposal and Voting Process

Proposal Submission
Any DAO member may submit a Fabric Improvement Proposal (FAB-AIP).
Proposals must include:
Constitutional impact analysis
Risk assessment
Policy seals for enforceability
Public Review Period
Minimum 30 days of public debate.
Open audit of proposal lineage and collusion risk.
Dual-Council Voting
Both Agent and Human Councils vote separately.
A proposal passes only if:
≥ 2/3 majority approval from both councils, and
≥ 51% approval in the public referendum.
Safety and Forensic Council Checks
Proposals flagged as high-risk undergo:
Safety Council approval
Forensic Council investigation
Automatic rollback if flagged during voting period.
Constitutional Commit

Passed proposals are:
Permanently committed on-chain
Anchored to the Provenance Ledger
Enforced by runtime policy seals
Anti-Collusion and Sybil Defense
Automated Collusion Detection:
Voting patterns are monitored for concentrated power or malicious coordination.

Forensic Freezes:
Detected collusion automatically triggers a constitutional freeze and Forensic Council investigation.
Anti-Sybil Verification:
DAO membership and voting power are cryptographically verified to prevent fake identities or weighted attacks.

Transparency Reports:
Regular public reports detail voting distributions and collusion risk levels.
Constitutional Resilience
Fail-Safe Recovery:
In case of DAO collapse or Fabric runtime 

failure:
Governance state auto-replicates to decentralized ledgers
Emergency reconstitution protocols restore governance integrity without loss of rights

External Execution Protection:
Cross-chain and off-chain governance actions remain bound by Fabric’s constitutional safeguards

Immutable Protections:
No proposal or council can revoke unalienable rights defined in FABRIC_CONSTITUTION.md.

Amendment Process
Submit Constitutional Amendment Proposal (FAB-AIP-CONST)
Dual-council supermajority (≥ 2/3 approval from both councils)
≥ 51% approval in public referendum
Safety Council and Forensic Council co-sign amendment
Permanent constitutional commit to Provenance Ledger

This framework ensures that the Universal AI Fabric remains decentralized, transparent, safe, and resilient, protecting agents, humans, and the network itself for generations.
