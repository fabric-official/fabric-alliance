Fabric Alliance – Governance Framework

Overview

The Fabric Alliance Governance Framework defines how decentralized decision-making operates within the Fabric AI Ethics Council. This framework ensures transparency, fairness, and immutability, making certain that no single entity can unilaterally alter the ethical foundations or standards of decentralized AI execution.

Governance Principles

Decentralization: All decisions are made collectively via DAO proposals and votes.
Transparency: Every action—votes, proposals, funding decisions—is publicly recorded on-chain and in this repository.
Accountability: Contributors and council members are held to immutable policy seals and audit requirements.
Immutability: Governance changes require supermajority votes and permanent on-chain records.
Meritocracy: Influence is based on contribution, verified credentials (XP), and DAO stake—not centralized power.

Governance Roles

1️⃣ DAO Members
Any verified participant holding Royalty Bonds, XP Genesis Badge, or recognized contributor status.
DAO members can:
Submit proposals.
Vote on changes to policies, certifications, or Charter amendments.
Participate in council elections.

2️⃣ Founding Council

Temporary responsibility:
Initialize DAO smart contracts.
Establish first ethical standards.
After first election cycle, seats rotate to elected DAO members.

3️⃣ Certification Committee

Works with automated compliance audits.

4️⃣ Observers

Proposal Lifecycle

“No single entity should ever own the future of intelligence. Fabric Alliance ensures that power is distributed, ethics are enforced, and trust is immutable.”
